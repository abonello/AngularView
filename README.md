# Angular Views

## Project to practice the use of AngularJS views

This Project is published as a [Github Page](https://abonello.github.io/AngularView/).

I am to do a very basic page with a navigation bar at the top, a jumbotron below that and a view section below it. I might add a side bar just to give some structure to the page.

There will be 4 views that will be changed by using the navigation bar. Each view will hold some dummy text.

I will be using Bootstrap for layout.
